    "summary": "Version prior to fincity-django-allauth 0.28.0 contained a vulnerability allowing an attacker to alter the provider specific settings for ``SCOPE`` and/or ``AUTH_PARAMS`` (part of the larger ``SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS`` setting). The changes would persist across subsequent requests for all users, provided these settings were explicitly set within your project. These settings translate directly into request parameters, giving the attacker undesirable control over the OAuth(2) handshake. You are not affected if you did not explicitly configure these settings.",
