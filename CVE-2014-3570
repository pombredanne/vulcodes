    "identifier": "CVE-2014-3570",
    "summary": "Bignum squaring (BN_sqr) may produce incorrect results on some platforms, including x86_64. This bug occurs at random with a very low probability, and is not known to be exploitable in any way, though its exact impact is difficult to determine. The following has been determined: *) The probability of BN_sqr producing an incorrect result at random is very low: 1/2^64 on the single affected 32-bit platform (MIPS) and 1/2^128 on affected 64-bit platforms. *) On most platforms, RSA follows a different code path and RSA operations are not affected at all. For the remaining platforms (e.g. OpenSSL built without assembly support), pre-existing countermeasures thwart bug attacks [1]. *) Static ECDH is theoretically affected: it is possible to construct elliptic curve points that would falsely appear to be on the given curve. However, there is no known computationally feasible way to construct such points with low order, and so the security of static ECDH private keys is believed to be unaffected. *) Other routines known to be theoretically affected are modular exponentiation, primality testing, DSA, RSA blinding, JPAKE and SRP. No exploits are known and straightforward bug attacks fail - either the attacker cannot control when the bug triggers, or no private key material is involved."
