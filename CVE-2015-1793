    "summary": "An error in the implementation of the alternative certificate chain logic could allow an attacker to cause certain checks on untrusted certificates to be bypassed, such as the CA flag, enabling them to use a valid leaf certificate to act as a CA and \"issue\" an invalid certificate."
