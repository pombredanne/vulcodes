    "identifier": "CVE-2011-3207",
    "summary": "Under certain circumstances OpenSSL's internal certificate verification routines can incorrectly accept a CRL whose nextUpdate field is in the past. Applications are only affected by the CRL checking vulnerability if they enable OpenSSL's internal CRL checking which is off by default. Applications which use their own custom CRL checking (such as Apache) are not affected."
