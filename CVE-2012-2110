{
    "identifier": "CVE-2012-2110",
    "summary": "Multiple numeric conversion errors, leading to a buffer overflow, were found in the way OpenSSL parsed ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) data from BIO (OpenSSL's I/O abstraction) inputs. Specially-crafted DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoded data read from a file or other BIO input could cause an application using the OpenSSL library to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code."
