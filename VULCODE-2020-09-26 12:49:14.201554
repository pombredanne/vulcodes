    "summary": "Before mitogen version 0.2.8, unidirectional routing, where contexts may optionally only communicate with parents and never siblings (so that air-gapped networks cannot be unintentionally bridged) was not inherited when a child was initiated directly from another child. This did not effect Ansible, since the controller initiates any new child used for routing, only forked tasks are initiated by children [gh:commit:`5924af15`].",
