    "summary": "starcluster before 0.95.3 opens up the VPC to the internet by default which is a security risk and it requires a special VPC configuration (internet gateway attached to the VPC and a route to the gateway with dest CIDR block 0.0.0.0/0 associated with the VPC subnet).  Configuring this automatically (which does not happen currently) would be a security risk and without this configuration StarCluster cannot connect to the VPC nodes even though they've been assigned a public IP.",
