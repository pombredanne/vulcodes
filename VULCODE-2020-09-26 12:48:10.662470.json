Upgrading avoids the XSS bug potentially caused by serializer allowing attribute values to be escaped out of in old browser versions, changing the quote_attr_values option on serializer to take one of three values, \"always\" (the old True value), \"legacy\" (the new option,  and the new default), and \"spec\" (the old False value, and the old default).",
