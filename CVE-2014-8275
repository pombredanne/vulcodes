{
    "identifier": "CVE-2014-8275",
    "summary": "OpenSSL accepts several non-DER-variations of certificate signature algorithm and signature encodings. OpenSSL also does not enforce a match between the signature algorithm between the signed and unsigned portions of the certificate. By modifying the contents of the signature algorithm or the encoding of the signature, it is possible to change the certificate's fingerprint. This does not allow an attacker to forge certificates, and does not affect certificate verification or OpenSSL servers/clients in any other way. It also does not affect common revocation mechanisms. Only custom applications that rely on the uniqueness of the fingerprint (e.g. certificate blacklists) may be affected."
