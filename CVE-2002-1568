    "identifier": "CVE-2002-1568",
    "summary": "The use of assertions when detecting buffer overflow attacks allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) by sending certain messages to cause OpenSSL to abort from a failed assertion, as demonstrated using SSLv2 CLIENT_MASTER_KEY messages, which were not properly handled in s2_srvr.c."
