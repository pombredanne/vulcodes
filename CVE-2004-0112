    "identifier": "CVE-2004-0112",
    "summary": "A flaw in SSL/TLS handshaking code when using Kerberos ciphersuites. A remote attacker could perform a carefully crafted SSL/TLS handshake against a server configured to use Kerberos ciphersuites in such a way as to cause OpenSSL to crash. Most applications have no ability to use Kerberos ciphersuites and will therefore be unaffected.",
