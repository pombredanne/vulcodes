    "identifier": "CVE-2016-0704",
    "summary": "This issue only affected versions of OpenSSL prior to March 19th 2015 at which time the code was refactored to address the vulnerability CVE-2015-0293. s2_srvr.c overwrite the wrong bytes in the master-key when applying Bleichenbacher protection for export cipher suites. This provides a Bleichenbacher oracle, and could potentially allow more efficient variants of the DROWN attack."
