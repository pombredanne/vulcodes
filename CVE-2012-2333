    "identifier": "CVE-2012-2333",
    "summary": "An integer underflow flaw, leading to a buffer over-read, was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, and DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) application data record lengths when using a block cipher in CBC (cipher-block chaining) mode.
