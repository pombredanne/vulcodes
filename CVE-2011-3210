    "identifier": "CVE-2011-3210",
    "summary": "OpenSSL server code for ephemeral ECDH ciphersuites is not thread-safe, and furthermore can crash if a client violates the protocol by sending handshake messages in incorrect order. Only server-side applications that specifically support ephemeral ECDH ciphersuites are affected, and only if ephemeral ECDH ciphersuites are enabled in the configuration."
