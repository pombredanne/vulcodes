    "summary": "Please upgrade to 1.8.0 immediately.\r\n\r\nVersions 1.6.6 to 1.7.1 are vulnerable to code execution. If you are running a vulnerable version, a malicious website owner could craft a page which executes arbitrary Python code on the machine that runs this script. This can only occur if the website that the user attempts to scrape has specifically prepared a page to exploit vulnerable versions of cfscrape.",
