    "summary": "Barman 2.11 removes the strict superuser requirement for PG 10+. As of PostgreSQL 10 it is possible to execute \r\nbackups without superuser privileges, which is actually the recommended method for security reasons. Non-superuser backups need to grant some privileges to the user used by Barman to connect to PostgreSQL, as documented in the 21-preliminary_steps.en.md section.\r\n\r\nIt also ensures each postgres connection has an empty search_path. This is the only safe option when there is no information about how secure the search path is on the target database. This is done by appending \"options=-csearch_path=\" to any conninfo string.",
