    "identifier": "CVE-2015-0290",
    "summary": "Multiblock corrupted pointer. OpenSSL 1.0.2 introduced the \"multiblock\" performance improvement. This feature only applies on 64 bit x86 architecture platforms that support AES NI instructions. A defect in the implementation of \"multiblock\" can cause OpenSSL's internal write buffer to become incorrectly set to NULL when using non-blocking IO. Typically, when the user application is using a socket BIO for writing, this will only result in a failed connection. However if some other BIO is used then it is likely that a segmentation fault will be triggered, thus enabling a potential DoS attack."
