    "identifier": "CVE-2009-0789",
    "summary": "When a malformed ASN1 structure is received it's contents are freed up and zeroed and an error condition returned. On a small number of platforms where sizeof(long) < sizeof(void *) (for example WIN64) this can cause an invalid memory access later resulting in a crash when some invalid structures are read, for example RSA public keys."
