    "identifier": "CVE-2011-4577",
    "summary": "RFC 3779 data can be included in certificates, and if it is malformed, may trigger an assertion failure. This could be used in a denial-of-service attack. Builds of OpenSSL are only vulnerable if configured with \"enable-rfc3779\", which is not a default."
