{
    "identifier": "CVE-2004-0975",
    "summary": "The der_chop script created temporary files insecurely which could allow local users to overwrite files via a symlink attack on temporary files. Note that it is quite unlikely that a user would be using the redundant der_chop script, and this script was removed from the OpenSSL distribution."
