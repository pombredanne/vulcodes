    "identifier": "CVE-2003-0078",
    "summary": "sl3_get_record in s3_pkt.c did not perform a MAC computation if an incorrect block cipher padding was used, causing an information leak (timing discrepancy) that may make it easier to launch cryptographic attacks that rely on distinguishing between padding and MAC verification errors, possibly leading to extraction of the original plaintext, aka the \"Vaudenay timing attack.\""
