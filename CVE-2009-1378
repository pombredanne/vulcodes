    "identifier": "CVE-2009-1378",
    "summary": "Fix a denial of service flaw in the DTLS implementation. In dtls1_process_out_of_seq_message() the check if the current message is already buffered was missing. For every new message was memory allocated, allowing an attacker to perform an denial of service attack against a DTLS server by sending out of seq handshake messages until there is no memory left."
