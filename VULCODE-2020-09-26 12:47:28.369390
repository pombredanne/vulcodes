    "summary": "In fincity-django-allauth 0.18.0, the Persona provider now requires the ``AUDIENCE`` parameter to be explicitly configured, as required by the Persona specification for security reasons. Also, the inline Javascript is removed from the ``fbconnect.html`` template, which allows for a more strict ``Content-Security-Policy``. If you were using the builtin ``fbconnect.html`` this change should go by unnoticed.",
