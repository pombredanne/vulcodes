    "identifier": "CVE-2016-6581",
    "summary": "Hhpack 2.3.0 enforces a maximum value of the decompressed size of the header list. This is to avoid the so-called \"HPACK Bomb\" vulnerability, which is caused when a malicious peer sends a compressed HPACK body that decompresses to a gigantic header list size. See: CVE-2016-6581.\r\n\r\nHhpack 2.3.0 also adds a 'OversizedHeaderListError', which is thrown by the 'decode' method if the maximum header list size is being violated. This places the HPACK decoder into a broken state: it must not be used after this exception is thrown.\r\n\r\nLastly, hhpack 2.3.0 adds a 'max_header_list_size' to the 'Decoder' object. This controls the maximum allowable decompressed size of the header list. By default this is set to 64kB.",
