    "identifier": "CVE-2017-16763",
    "summary": "An exploitable vulnerability exists in the YAML parsing functionality in config.py in Confire 0.2.0. Due to the user-specific configuration being loaded from \"~/.confire.yaml\" using the yaml.load function, a YAML parser can execute arbitrary Python commands resulting in command execution. An attacker can insert Python into loaded YAML to trigger this vulnerability.",
