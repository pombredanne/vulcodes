    "summary": "In confidant 5.0.0, requirements have been updated to resolve some reported security vulnerabilities in a few of the frozen requirements. A library affecting user sessions was upgraded which will cause users to be logged out after upgrade, which means if you're doing a rolling upgrade, that during the upgrade, you may have users that seemingly randomly get logged out. After a finished upgrade, users should only be logged out once, if they're currently logged in.",
