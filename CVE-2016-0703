    "identifier": "CVE-2016-0703",
    "summary": "This issue only affected versions of OpenSSL prior to March 19th 2015 at which time the code was refactored to address vulnerability CVE-2015-0293. s2_srvr.c did not enforce that clear-key-length is 0 for non-export ciphers. If clear-key bytes are present for these ciphers, they *displace* encrypted-key bytes. This leads to an efficient divide-and-conquer key recovery attack: if an eavesdropper has intercepted an SSLv2 handshake, they can use the server as an oracle to determine the SSLv2 master-key, using only 16 connections to the server and negligible computation. More importantly, this leads to a more efficient version of DROWN that is effective against non-export ciphersuites, and requires no significant computation."
